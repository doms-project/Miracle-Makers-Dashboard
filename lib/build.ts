/**
 * 🔴 WHICH BUILD IS ON THE SCREEN — round 115.
 *
 * Five rounds running, a harness has passed and the live dashboard has behaved
 * differently, and every one of those investigations began by ASSUMING the
 * deployed code was the code I had just written. That assumption has never once
 * been checked, because there was nothing on screen to check it with.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS NOT A VERSION NUMBER FOR ITS OWN SAKE. It is the first question of
 * every bug report from here on: "what does the footer say?" If it says 114 and
 * the fix went out in 115, the investigation is over in one line instead of a
 * round. If it says 115 and the bug is still there, then the bug is real and I
 * stop looking for deployment explanations.
 *
 * Bump ROUND in the same commit as the round's work. Nothing derives it
 * automatically on purpose: a stamp that updates itself on every rebuild tells
 * you when the bundle was made, not which round's changes are in it.
